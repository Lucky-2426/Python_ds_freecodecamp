# Data Science with Python Course - Freecodecamp

This is my Python code for the certified course created by Frecodecamp [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/]. 

I took this course to solidify my basic knowledge in Python, baiscally focusing on libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. 

It allows to practice hands-on exercises like :
- Connect to a database using SQLLite in Python
- Load the database using pandas
- Data cleaning and processing with numpy and pandas
- Data analysis with pandas & matplotlib
